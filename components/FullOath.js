        <p>
          As a software engineer, I recognize the immense impact that my work
          can have on the world around me. Whether I am developing applications,
          designing systems, or creating algorithms, I understand that the
          choices I make can affect the lives of individuals, organizations, and
          entire communities, the environment and the world at large.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this awareness comes a great responsibility - a responsibility to
          act with integrity, to prioritize the safety and well-being of users
          and stakeholders, and to strive for fairness, transparency, privacy,
          and accessibility in all my endeavors.
        </p>
        <p>
          In recognition of this responsibility, I pledge to uphold the core
          values of integrity, responsibility, transparency, privacy, fairness,
          safety and reliability, and continuous learning in my work as a
          software engineer. Through this oath, I commit to using my skills and
          knowledge for the greater good, serving the needs of those who rely on
          my work, and contributing to the advancement of the software
          engineering field.
        </p>
        <p>
          With these principles in mind, I now take the following oath to guide
          my work as a software engineer:
